### A sample html project containing HTML, CSS and Javascript
html file index.html contains code to show a button and on click of that button, it shows "Hello webpack!!". Clicking again on the same button hides the message. This is kind of message toggler which acts on button click. But till now it does not uses any webpack feature. When you double click on the html file, it opens on the browser and loads the required scripts.
